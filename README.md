# Blitzkrieg

Pyweek 33 game jam in arcade.

As the theme is "My evil twin", the plot I thought for my game is where two twin brothers get their Dad's kingdoms in
half, but the evil twin brother throws you outside where you are just left with a city. So by some military tactics and
warfare you have to take the kingdom back. Basically this game is military strategy game and the literal meaning of "
Blitzkrieg" is "a violent surprise offensive by massed air forces and mechanized ground forces in close coordination".
