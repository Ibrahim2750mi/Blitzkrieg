# Blitzkrieg

Pyweek 33 game jam in arcade.

As the theme is "My evil twin", the plot I thought for my game is where two twin brothers get their Dad's kingdoms in
half, but the evil twin brother throws you outside where you are just left with a city. So by some military tactics and
warfare you have to take the kingdom back. Basically this game is military strategy game and the literal meaning of "
Blitzkrieg" is "a violent surprise offensive by massed air forces and mechanized ground forces in close coordination".

# Running the Game

On OSx<br>
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
`cd src`<br>
`python3 game.py`<br>

On Windows<br>
`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
Go to the src directory and then run<br>
`py game.py`<br>

# Playing the Game

You can manage your kingdom by clicking on the office, building an army building is important. Buildings like hospital,
finance office can provide some kingdom boost (although I had to cut off some features due to time limit). You can open
the menu by clicking on the cog wheel icon on the top left of the screen. You can go to battle by clicking on the map
button, winning battles is your main objective and taking all the cities under your control. Some features were not
implemented like dialogues, generals etc. You may see alot of redundant code that is because, they might have been used
if I had more time. Anyway good luck winning your kingdom back from your evil twin. Also, you need to click on 
"SAVE and CONTINUE" button in the map view.

Cheat:
When in battle press "w" to kill all enemies.
